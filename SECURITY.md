# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety and reliability of our project. Currently, we do not have any officially released versions. As a result, there are no versions being supported with security updates at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we appreciate your responsible disclosure and assistance in making our project more secure. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Contact**: Send an email to [security@project-name.com](mailto:security@project-name.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please include any relevant information that can help us understand and reproduce the issue.

2. **Response**: You can expect an initial response to your report within 72 hours, acknowledging receipt of your report and providing an estimated timeline for investigation.

3. **Investigation**: Our security team will thoroughly investigate the reported vulnerability to determine its validity and impact.

4. **Resolution**: Once the issue is confirmed and analyzed, we will work diligently to develop and test a fix. The timeline for resolution may vary depending on the complexity of the vulnerability.

5. **Disclosure**: We prioritize the safety of our users and the security of our project. We will coordinate the disclosure of the vulnerability and the release of a security update with you. We may request that you hold off on disclosing the vulnerability to the public until we have had sufficient time to address it.

6. **Acknowledgment**: As a token of our appreciation for your responsible disclosure, we may acknowledge your contribution in our release notes or on our website (if you wish to be credited).

Please note that while we take security matters seriously, this project is currently in development, and we advise against using it for any critical or high-stakes tasks. Avoid making significant financial decisions or investments in the market based on its output until the project reaches a stable and published state.

We intend to publish this project after its completion, at which point it may be suitable for various applications. To stay updated on the project's progress and receive notifications regarding its completion, please refer to the GitHub repository. We will provide a comprehensive .md (Markdown) file with detailed information about the bot and its capabilities.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we work diligently to improve the security of our project and ensure its readiness for broader use.
